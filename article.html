          <h1>Beginner's Guide: Why EXO is Out of this World</h1>
          <p>CEBU, Philippines - Have you seen a boy band come out with 23 teasers, 2 concerts, and 2 music videos even before their actual debut? Well, that's how extra EXO is!</p>
          <p>The 9-member Korean-Chinese boy band's popularity in the Philippines peaked after their electronic dance music single "Ko Ko Bop" went viral as a challenge in 2017. <br> Six years after their 2012 debut, their fans called EXO-Ls now count to nearly 4.4 million in official fan registry.</p>
          <p>Called the "biggest Korean boy band in the world", according to Dazed in 2016, EXO is currently a 9-member team with Suho, Kai, Sehun, Xiumin, Lay, Chen, D.O., Baekhyun, and Chanyeol.</p>
          <p><b>'Extra-terrestrial' debut</b> EXO started as a 12-member group with 2 independent subgroups, EXO-K (which performs in Korean) and EXO-M (which performs in Mandarin). After several changes, their management SM Entertainment finalized the group's name as EXO, inspired by the term "exoplanet". The boys attracted a lot of social media attention worldwide due to its unusual promotional campaigns. 
            Before their formal debut, SM Entertainment released 23 teasers, 2 solo shows, and 2 music videos for EXO. The company even tapped mobile billboards around Seoul to promote the group.</p>

          <h1>Streamlining Campus Security at CTU Danao with ID Swiping Gates</h1>
          <p>In an effort to enhance campus security and improve operational efficiency, Cebu Technological University (CTU) Danao has introduced a simple yet effective ID-based swipe gate system. This innovation ensures a seamless flow of students, staff, and visitors while maintaining strict control over campus access. Swipe gate systems are designed to manage and monitor the movement of individuals entering and exiting a facility.</p>
          <p><b>How the System Works</b></p>
          <p>The ID-based swipe gates at CTU Danao are designed for simplicity and efficiency. Here's how the process operates:</p>
          <p>1. <b>Approach the Gate</b></p>
          <p>Upon arriving at the campus, students make their way to the designed entrance or exit gates. Each gate is equipped with a card reader for quick and accurate scanning.</p>
          <p>2. <b>Swipe the ID Card</b></p>
          <p>To gain access, students must swipe or tap their student ID card on the reader. The system instantly verifies the card's authenticity.</p>
          <p>3. <b>Authentication Process</b></p>
          <p>* <b>Valid Card</b>: If the ID is verified, the gate opens automatically, allowing the students to enter ir exit.</p>
          <p>* <b>Invalid Card</b>: If the ID is not recognized or unauthorized, the gate remains closed, and "failed to log in" will display on the tv screen. Ask campus security for assistance.</p>
          <p>4. <b>Access and Logging</b></p>
          <p>As the student passes through the gate, their entry or exit is logged in real time. This feature not only enhances security but also provides a reliable system for tracking attendance and monitoring campus activity.</p>
          <p>5. <b>Repeat for Exit</b></p>
          <p>The same process applies when leaving the campus, ensuring that movement is recorded for both entrance and exit points.</p>
          <p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
          <p>By introducing ID-based swipe gates, CTU Danao can enhance its capus security, improve operational efficiency, andnprovide a safer environment for its students and staff. This initiative not only address current challenges but also positions the university as a leader in adopting smart, technology-driven solutions for education. This transformation will reinforce CTU Danao's reputations as a progressive institution ready to meet the demands of modern education and campus management.</p>
